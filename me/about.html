							<p>
								I grew up in Memphis, TN, with an older sister and a younger
								brother. Matthew, my brother, is on the far right of this picture,
								and my dad is in the middle. I've always loved my family. I grew
								up going to church, and I was in Boy Scouts. I still go to church,
								and I earned the rank of Eagle Scout in Boy Scouts. My dad has
								always pushed me to be the best that I can be, and I really have
								to thank him for that.
							</p>

							<p>
								I'm 23 years old. I like to listen to 70's and 80's rock as well
								as a lot of popular music today. I play the guitar, I'm a
								photographer, I ride a motorcycle(ok, it's a street legal dirt
								bike), and I like to cook. I've got a very unique birthmark
								directly below my right eye, and it looks like I have a black
								eye. During school, I get to learn new programming languages,
								how to work a microprocessor, advanced circuits, and much more.
								It's pretty tough subject matter, but I enjoy most of it, which
								helps get me through it. My favorite part about college is the
								fact that I am studying so many things that I actually enjoy.
								I'm now in my 4th year of school, and I feel like I have really
								matured since Freshman year. I have a great group of friends in
								my classes that I can study with, and I set aside many hours
								each week working on classwork. I know that Mississippi State
								has done a fantastic job at preparing me for a job after college.
