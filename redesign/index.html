    <h1>Hello, my name is Noah Siano.</h1>

  <h2>I work on some really cool things.</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Software Engineering</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a Software Engineer, working with technologies like Typescript,
    LabVIEW, Git, .NET 5, and many more. I also work on some side-projects in my
    free time, like <a href="https://github.com/AFTERWAKE/IRCBots" target="_blank">
    these cool IRC bots</a> my friends and I made in college, or this website. I'm
    comfortable in both a Windows and Ubunutu environment, and I am Security+
    Certified. I am also very familiar with Agile and Scaled Agile Framework, and
    I am a Scrum Master.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been working professionally with software since 2016. I have experience
    working with: <br />
    Android Studio, Assembly (PIC24 and MIPS), Bash, C (embedded system), C++,
    Git, Github, HTML/CSS/SASS, Java, Javascript and Typescript, Jira, LabVIEW,
    .NET Framework and Core, PHP, Python, Ubuntu (with and without a GUI), Verilog,
    Vim, and Wordpress.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>RF Engineering</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I am also an RF Engineer, working with technologies like S-band Telemetry,
    Ka-Band system design, and much more. I work in the space industry, and I am
    surrounded by endless innovation.
  </p>
  <h2>I'm a Computer Engineer.</h2>
  <p>
    I graduated from Mississippi State University in May 2019 with a Bachelor of
    Science in Computer Engineering. As part of my degree, I was exposed to both
    the electrical engineering and software engineering disciplines, and in my
    professional life, I have been dancing back and forth between software and
    electrical.
