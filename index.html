    <h1>Hi, I'm Noah Siano 👋</h1>
    <aside>Nice to meet you!</aside>

  <h2>A little about me</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>🤝 I'm in program management</strong>, overseeing execution of critical
    technology design reviews, facilitating effective communication across products,
    and coordinating with various products to ensure alignment to a program schedule.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>💻 I'm a Software Engineer</strong> by title, although my experience
    has spanned across the industry. Whether it's programming a user interface,
    working with a customer to determine the best user experience, troubleshooting
    hardware, installing a new rack, or writing and re-writing system requirements,
    I have a broad view of the engineering industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>🎓 I graduated from Mississippi State University</strong> in May 2019
    with a Bachelor of
    Science in Computer Engineering. As part of my degree, I was exposed to both
    the electrical engineering and software engineering disciplines, and in my
    professional life, I have been dancing back and forth between software and
    electrical.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Outside of work, I enjoy:</strong><br/>
    Baking desserts 🎂<br/>
    Watching dirt bike racing 🏁<br/>
    Scoping out the next best restaraunt in my area 🍔😋<br/>
    Using emojis in daily conversation 🕺
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>👨‍💼 I've been working professionally since 2016</strong>. I have experience
    working with: <br />
    Program execution and release management<br/>
    Programming in a wide variety of languages, primarily TypeScript or Python<br/>
    Designing satellite communications subsystems<br/>
    Website design
  </p>
  <h2>Ideals</h2>
  <p>
    I deeply enjoy working with creative and talented individuals. I believe a
    product should be continuously refined through incremental implementation of
    features, continuous customer feedback, and agility to change when needed.
  </p>
  <h2>I have some other personal projects</h2>
  <p>
    Over the years, I've worked on: <br/>
    📆 <a href="https://phillipac.github.io/Rydle/" target="_blank">A game where you guess the year something happened</a><br/>
    ☕ <a href="https://intelliroast.github.io/" target="_blank">An automated coffee bean roaster</a><br/>
    🤖 <a href="https://github.com/AFTERWAKE/IRCBots" target="_blank">A bunch of IRC Bots</a><br/>
    🏕️ <a href="https://github.com/afterthought325/LoneForest" target="_blank">An online text-based adventure game</a><br/>
    and more.
  </p>
  <h3>& I'm known to be good at:</h3>
  <p>
    Teaching the group a new board game (and then losing)<br/>
    Singing along to musicals (in the shower)<br/>
    Doing all my own car repairs (and learning from failure)<br/>
    Random trivia knowledge (from hours of Wikipedia surfing)
